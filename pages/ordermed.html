                        <p>You can cancel your order from the ‘Order Details’ screen before it is out for delivery.
                             Simply click on the Account icon at the bottom of the App Homepage > select ‘Orders’ > Select the 
                             order which you want to cancel > tap “Cancel”. You can also refuse it at the time of
                             delivery and a refund will be processed to the payment source, if the order amount was paid online.</p>
